GIT
-------
All file names start with the module
All source files belong in /src 
All object files belong in /src
All header files belong in /inc
The executable binary belongs in /

GENERAL
-------
Use real tabs that equal 4 spaces.
Use typically trailing braces everywhere (if, else, functions, structures, typedefs, class definitions, etc.)
if ( x ) {
}

The else statement starts on the same line as the last closing brace.
if ( x ) {
} else {
}

Pad parenthesized expressions with spaces
if ( x ) {
}
Instead of
if (x) {
}
And
x = ( y * 0.5f );
Instead of
x = (y * 0.5f);

Use precision specification for floating point values unless there is an explicit need for a double.
float f = 0.5f;
Instead of
float f = 0.5;
And
float f = 1.0f;Instead of
float f = 1.f;

The standard header for functions is:
/*
====================
FunctionName
Description
====================
*/

Variable names start with a lower case character.
float x;

In multi-word variable names the first word starts with a lower case character and each successive word starts with an upper case.
float maxDistanceFromPlane;

Typedef names use the same naming convention as variables, however they always end with "_t".
typedef int fileHandle_t;

Struct names use the same naming convention as variables, however they always
end with "_t".Enum names use the same naming convention as variables, however they always end
with "_t". The enum constants use all upper case characters. Multiple words are separated with an underscore.
enum contact_t {
CONTACT_NONE,
CONTACT_EDGE,
CONTACT_MODELVERTEX,
CONTACT_TRMVERTEX
};

Names of recursive functions end with "_r"
void WalkBSP_r( int node );

Defined names use all upper case characters. Multiple words are separated with an underscore.
#define SIDE_FRONT

Use ‘const’ as much as possible.
