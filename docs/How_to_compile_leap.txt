Libaries used by the sample programs and should be updated for compiling many leap programs: 
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install g++ libGL-dev libGLU-dev libX11-dev libXi-dev \
       libfreetype6-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libasound-dev
Set linking path: 
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib/x64 ./$(NAME)
Compile:
	g++ -Wall -g -I../include $(NAME).cpp -o $(NAME) $(LEAP_LIBRARY)
	NOTE: ../include should have Leap.h and LeapMath.h if you are using it
	NOTE: $(LEAP_LIBRARY) is LibLeap.so, it has to match your computer's arch. In all cases should be AMDx64 and the path should be ../lib/x64/libLeap.so
Run:
	cp ../lib/x64/libLeap.so .
	With libLeap copied in the same folder as the compiled application simply run your compiled app.
