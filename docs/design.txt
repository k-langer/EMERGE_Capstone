-Backend Design
we have three processes: lm_data, updater, controller

lm_data: collect data (xyz, palm direction, speed) from leap motion and insert into db

updater: get the last xyz data entry from db, translate xyz into robot command, validate the command, and then insert into db

controller: get command from db and pass command to robot via USB
